OpenStreetMap data for Des Moines Area

Description:
From Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Des_Moines,_Iowa)
Des Moines is the capital and the most populous city in the US state of Iowa
It is also the county seat of Polk County. A small portion of the city extends into
Warren County.

Reason:
I am currently a student at Iowa State University (ISU). I've been driving back and forth from
ISU to Des Moines several times. I want to audit and analyze Des Moines data to make the area
date cleaner and better used.
